        <p>My hobby is coding. Coding is my favorite pass time. When I get some free time after my studies,I go to my study room and sit in front of my laptop and start coding. Coding requires great creativity.

Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites. Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer. </p>
        <p> I also like music a lot, I've always wanted to be a lyricist. Once in a while I suddently get an idea for a song and I can't rest without writing it down.</p>
